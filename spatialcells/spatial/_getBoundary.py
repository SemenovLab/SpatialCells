    Get a boundary for the communities of interest as a Shapely MultiPolygon.

    The boundary is defined based on the alpha shape of points in the
    communities. The alpha shape is the generalization of the convex hull,
    and is generated via Delaunay triangulation of all the points of interest.
    The alpha parameter controls the longest edge that can appear in the alpha
    shape. Smaller alpha gives more detailed boundary, but may appear more
    jagged and may leave out some points that are too far away from the rest
    of the points.

    :param anndata: the anndata object
    :param communitycolumn: the column name of the community
    :param communityIndexList: the list of community indexes
    :param alpha: the alpha parameter for alpha shape. Smaller alpha gives
        more detailed boundary, but may appear more jagged.
    :param debug: whether to return the polygons and edge components
    :return: the boundaries of components as a MultiPolygon object
